## Introduction

The Memory Game Project is part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree, and showcases the uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The purpose of the game is to match the 8 different pairs of cards. 

The game board consists of sixteen 'cards' arranged in a grid and each deck is made up of 8 different pairs of cards. In the beginning of the game, the cards are shuffled and 'placed face down' in the grid. The user will be able to select 2 cards at a time, trying to match the pairs. 

If the cards match, the cards stay opened 'face up'. If the cards do not match, they are flipped over 'face down' and the user continues to match the cards. 

The game ends when the user has matched all 8 different pairs of cards.
